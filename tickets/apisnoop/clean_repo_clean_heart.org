#+TODO: TODO(t) IN-PROGRESS(i) WAITING(w) | DONE(d)

* Purpose
  Organize repo to have focused domains and org files that relate only to that domain.  This is to help avoid accidents by over-tangling in org files, and to make the repo easier to understand
* Process  
** DONE Isolate the areas that need fixing
   CLOSED: [2020-03-19 Thu 13:25]
  We could reorganize the folder structures to  have the various components at a top level, and each one contains its own app and deployment info 
  
  #+name: possible structure
  #+begin_example
    | Auditlogger
      - app
      - deployment
      -index.org
    | hasura
      - app
      - deployment
      - index.org
    org
    readme.org
  #+end_example
  
  it's a possible, and discussing it with the team we unanimously like it...so we're doing it.

***** ATTIC xip.io
      This is still interesting, so moved to attic
***** D kubemacs
      all this is contaioned in kubemacs own repo now. DELETED
***** ATTIC kubemacs.org
      Seems like there's quite a bit of research here, so we are preserving it in the attic.

      don't think we are using it, but uncertainty means ATTIC
***** ATTIC hh

*** DONE kustomize
    CLOSED: [2020-03-19 Thu 13:11]
    nothing not needed, but will be moved in to the various app folders
*** DONE org
    CLOSED: [2020-03-19 Thu 13:25]
    We moved tickets and docs to the root since we are moving to a place where org files are in eveyr folder and don't need to be separate.  Our explorations and archives are still held in norg.
** [7/7] Fix these areas

** DONE Move tickets org up to root, and separate into k8s and api tickets
   CLOSED: [2020-03-19 Thu 16:39]
* Conclusion | Next Steps
** Research how to keep go.mod and go.sum separate from our ticket dir
   They are used in the go functions executed in org babel, and it works cos it's go looking for these files in the pwd.  Is there a way we can set the path of these files in all go src blocks, so this isn't needed?
