We'll need to set this up in a sustainable/supportable way. - [X] DNS prow.cncf.io pointing to prow.apisnoop.io - [X] Grant cncf-ci bot permissions to cncf github org - [X] Deploy clusters for prow.cncf.io - [X] Deploy prow onto said clusters - [ ] Researching the isolation / clusters used by test-infra / k8s-infra-wg - [ ] Look into setting up #wg-cncf-infra if there is interest *** KR2 Connect cncf/k8s-conformance to prow.cncf.io Comments and admin actions from prow.cncf.io Will be made using the [[https://github.com/cncf-ci][cncf-ci]] bot/github account. - [X] Enable [[https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pull/971][meow]] and simple prow bot plugins *** KR3 gate+comment w/ list of unrun conformance tests - [ ] generate list of test run in a PR - [ ] generate list of tests required for PR version - [ ] comment with list of missing tests if under 20 - [ ] comment with count of missing test if over 20 - [ ] add hold tag if test lists don't match **** definition Influenced by [[https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/2c19ec7627e326d1c75306dcaa3d2f14002301fa/keps/sig-architecture/960-conformance-behaviors/README.md#role-cncf-conformance-program][user stories for KEP-960]] #+begin_example Must confirm that the version of the tests being run matches...

** Gate k/k PRs touching test/e2e or API
- [[https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/30][k/k API+Conformance Gate]]
*** Background
 Influenced by [[https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103][Behavior KEP user stories]] while continuing to focus on endpoints!

 #+begin_quote
 Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased.
 #+end_quote

 #+begin_quote
 Comment: "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"
 #+end_quote
*** OKing PR

#+begin_quote
Existing responsiblity via owners file ensures that PRs touching swagger or conformance tests are **/approved** by right people.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
A label of **requires-conformance** will applied, and **conformance** label will need to be added by this gate + automation.
#+end_quote
*** KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review
PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

- (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
- [ ] Create ~run_if_changed~ presubmit

#+begin_example
eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance
#+end_example
*** KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed
Tooling will compare ~path/operation_id~ in ~api/openapi-spec/swagger.json~
- [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints
*** KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage
Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.
- [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
- [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints
*** KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints
Tooling will comment directly on PR

- [ ] alpha : endpoints needing tests
- [ ] beta : endpoints needing tests
- [ ] stable : comment+block via tag

You've added api's without tests it will not be able to reach stable.
*** KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)
Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

- [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
- [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected
*** KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch
- [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
- [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
- [ ] Migration maybe in Q3
** Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints
*** KR1 (5/+40) new conformant stable endpoints
**** 5 DONE
- +5 Merged [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89753][#89753]]
**** X IN-PROGRESS
- +3 SOAK - Waiting for /approve
*** KR2 +9% Coverage Increase 36.46%->45.46%
*** KR3 (stretch +49) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests
