#+TITLE: VIM Commands Summary


* Purpose                                                          :vim:tips:
-- Note: This became repository for all cmd cheats picked up over the last couple of weeks, need a way to group them, also easy reference? current is open and search... keywords still not refined

These tips are for using the VIM mode of Spacemacs.
* Basics
- Insertion mode, type i or a to insert after the cursor.
- To get back into normal mode, press the Esc key or rapidly press f d.
- Pressing <ESC> will place you in normal state or will cancel an unwanted and partially completed command.
- These commands are executed in command mode / normal state.
* Command format

 The format for a command in Command Mode (normal state) is:
: [number]  command  object
OR
: command  [number]  object
where:
- number :: how many times to repeat the command
- command :: what to do (e.g. =d=  for delete)
- object :: is what the command should act upon, such as  =w=  for word.
* Editor
** Switch on menu bar: Spc Spc Type: Menu and select Menu-bar-mode
** Quit   =SPACE q q=
** Increase/decrease font size   =SPACE z x= (+ k, k, etc. -j, j etc.)
** To see all open buffers Type =Spc bb=
** Cancel incomplete / wrong command type: =Clt G=
** Insert a hyperlink =,i l= - Then type the hyperlink + Enter, Type text associated with hyperlink + Enter


Note: Combinations of referring to text object using:
- w for word
- S for sentence
- p for paragraph

** find a character forward in a line and move until it (one character before) =t<char>=
** (f)ind a character backward in a line and move to it =F<char>=
** find a character backward in a line and move until it =T<char>=
** repeat last f, t, F, or T command =;=
** To find other instances of a word, while on the word, =**=
hightlight all the same words and type n to go to the next word.

Note: Use f & t (or F&T) is combination with other commands to build a new command ie. dtx = delete till x or ytb = yank till b

eg. Type  cw  to change from the cursor to the end of the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line. The format for change is:      [number]  c  object    OR    c  [number]  object
** change everything between quotes   =c i “=
(this also works for parens, single quotes, etc.)
